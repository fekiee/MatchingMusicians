# MatchingMusicians
As part of a college project the main idea was to create a website where musicians from different backgrounds and playing different musical generes can get together as result of system that checks their behaviour pattern on Spotify in order to bring them together to play music.

The Application that searches user Spotify top-artist to create potential musical band matches based on artist genres

Spotify keeps records of what users are listening to the most in other words, the user top artists.
This data keeps record of the most frequently artists listened including information regarding to the artist popularity, followers, genres among other information, as initial phase genres can be used as parameter to create musician matching algorithm.

The matching concept would basically be like this: John likes "Blues" Peter likes "Blues" so these parameters might be an indicator of a potential match between these musicians so the system would sujest each others so they can get in contact.
